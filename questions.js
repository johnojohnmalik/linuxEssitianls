const QUESTIONS = [
  { id: 1, question: "What are the differences between hard disk drives and solid state disks? (Choose two.)", options: { A: "Hard disks have a motor and moving parts, solid state disks do not.", B: "Hard disks can fail due to physical damage, while solid state disks cannot fail.", C: "Solid state disks can store many times as much data as hard disk drives.", D: "/dev/sda is a hard disk device while /dev/ssda is a solid state disk.", E: "Solid state disks provide faster access to stored data than hard disks." }, answer: "AE", explanation: "HDDs have moving parts (motors); SSDs do not. SSDs use flash memory for faster access. /dev/ssda is not a standard device name; SSDs use the same /dev/sdX naming." },
  { id: 2, question: "Reverse DNS assigns hostnames to IP addresses. How is the name of the IP address 198.51.100.165 stored on a DNS server?", options: { A: "In the A record for 165.100.51.198.ipv4.arpa.", B: "In the PTR record for 165.100.51.198.in-addr.arpa.", C: "In the RNAME record for 198-51-100-165.rev.arpa.", D: "In the ARPA record for 165.100.51.198.rev.", E: "In the REV record for arpa.in-addr.198.51.100.165." }, answer: "B", explanation: "PTR (pointer) records are used for reverse DNS lookups. The IP is reversed and appended with .in-addr.arpa (e.g. 165.100.51.198.in-addr.arpa)." },
  { id: 3, question: "Which of the following types of bus can connect hard disk drives with the motherboard?", options: { A: "The RAM bus", B: "The NUMA bus", C: "The CPU bus", D: "The SATA bus", E: "The Auto bus" }, answer: "D", explanation: "SATA (Serial ATA) is the standard bus interface that connects hard drives and SSDs to the motherboard. RAM, NUMA, and CPU buses are for memory/CPU, not disk." },
  { id: 4, question: "Members of a team already have experience using Red Hat Enterprise Linux. For a small hobby project, the team wants to set up a Linux server without paying for a subscription. Which Linux distribution allows them to apply as much of their RHEL knowledge as possible?", options: { A: "Ubuntu Linux LTS", B: "Raspbian", C: "Debian GNU/Linux", D: "CentOS", E: "openSUSE" }, answer: "D", explanation: "CentOS is built from RHEL source code and is binary-compatible, so RHEL skills transfer directly. Ubuntu, Debian, and openSUSE use different package managers and layouts." },
  { id: 5, question: "What information can be displayed by top?", options: { A: "Existing files, ordered by their size.", B: "Running processes, ordered by CPU or RAM consumption.", C: "User accounts, ordered by the number of logins.", D: "User groups, ordered by the number of members.", E: "User accounts, ordered by the number of files." }, answer: "B", explanation: "The top command shows a live, sorted list of running processes (by CPU or memory by default). It does not list files, users, or groups." },
  { id: 6, question: "Which of the following commands can be used to resolve a DNS name to an IP address?", options: { A: "dnsname", B: "dns", C: "query", D: "host", E: "iplookup" }, answer: "D", explanation: "The host command performs DNS lookups and can resolve hostnames to IP addresses. Commands like dnsname, dns, query, and iplookup are not standard." },

It does not show disk usage, network interfaces, or process lists." },
  { id: 8, question: "What is true about the dmesg command? (Choose two.)", options: { A: "It traces the execution of a command and shows each step the program carries out.", B: "It sends messages to the command lines of all current user sessions.", C: "It displays the content of the Linux kernel's ring buffer.", D: "It immediately outputs all new messages written to the system journal.", E: "It might not display older information because it was overwritten by newer information." }, answer: "CE", explanation: "dmesg reads the kernel ring buffer, which holds boot and hardware messages. It is a fixed-size buffer, so older messages can be overwritten by newer ones." },
  { id: 9, question: "Which of the following outputs could stem from the command last?", options: { A: "1 ls 2 cat text.txt 3 logout", B: "Password for user last changed at Sat Mar 31 16:38:57 EST 2018", C: "Last login: Fri Mar 23 10:56:39 2018 from server.example.com", D: "EXT4-fs (dm-7): mounted filesystem with ordered data mode.", E: "root tty2 Wed May 17 21:11 - 21:11 (00:00)" }, answer: "E", explanation: "The last command shows login history. Option E is the typical format: user, TTY, date/time, and session duration. Other options are from other commands (e.g. chsh, lastlog, dmesg)." },
  { id: 10, question: "What is the UID of the user root?", options: { A: "1", B: "-1", C: "255", D: "65536", E: "0" }, answer: "E", explanation: "Root always has UID 0 on Linux/Unix systems. This is reserved and consistent across all distributions." },
  { id: 11, question: "Which permissions are set on a regular file once the permissions have been modified with the command chmod 654 file.txt?", options: { A: "drw-r-xr-", B: "d-wxr-x-", C: "-wxr-x--x", D: "-rwxrw---x", E: "-rw-r-xr--" }, answer: "E", explanation: "chmod 654 gives owner 6 (rw-), group 5 (r-x), others 4 (r--). A regular file starts with - (directory would be d), so the result is -rw-r-xr--." },
  { id: 12, question: "What is true about the owner of a file?", options: { A: "Each file is owned by exactly one user and one group.", B: "The owner of a file always has full permissions when accessing the file.", C: "The user owning a file must be a member of the file's group.", D: "When a user is deleted, all files owned by the user disappear.", E: "The owner of a file cannot be changed once it is assigned to an owner." }, answer: "A", explanation: "In Linux, every file has exactly one owner (user) and one group. The owner can be changed with chown; deleting a user does not delete files; the owner is not required to be in the file's group." },
  { id: 13, question: "Which of the following permissions are set on the /tmp/ directory?", options: { A: "rwxrwxrwt", B: "------rwX", C: "rwSrw-rw-", D: "rwxrwS--", E: "r-xr-X--t" }, answer: "A", explanation: "/tmp uses rwxrwxrwt: world-writable with the sticky bit (t). The sticky bit lets anyone create files but only delete their own, which is required for a shared temp directory." },
  { id: 14, question: "Which command adds the new user tux and creates the user's home directory with default configuration files?", options: { A: "defaultuser tux", B: "useradd -m tux", C: "usercreate tux", D: "useradd -o default tux", E: "passwd -a tux" }, answer: "B", explanation: "useradd -m creates the user and a home directory (-m) with default config files from /etc/skel. usercreate and defaultuser do not exist; passwd sets passwords." },
  { id: 15, question: "What information is stored in /etc/passwd? (Choose three.)", options: { A: "The user's storage space limit", B: "The numerical user ID", C: "The username", D: "The encrypted password", E: "The user's default shell" }, answer: "BCE", explanation: "/etc/passwd holds username, UID, GID, home dir, and default shell. Encrypted passwords are in /etc/shadow, not passwd (for security)." },
  { id: 16, question: "Which of the following tar options handle compression? (Choose two.)", options: { A: "-bz", B: "-z", C: "-g", D: "-j", E: "-z2" }, answer: "BD", explanation: "tar -z uses gzip compression; -j uses bzip2. Options -bz, -g, -z2 are not standard tar compression flags." },
  { id: 17, question: "What keyword is used in a shell script to begin a loop? (FILL BLANK - one keyword only)", options: null, answer: "for", explanation: "The for keyword starts a loop in shell scripts (e.g. for i in 1 2 3; do ... done). while and until also start loops, but the question asks for the keyword that begins a loop; for is the primary one." },
  { id: 18, question: "Which of the following commands creates an archive file work.tar from the contents of the directory ./work/?", options: { A: "tar --new work.tar ./work/", B: "tar -cf work.tar ./work/", C: "tar -create work.tgz -content ./work/", D: "tar work.tar < ./work/", E: "tar work > work.tar" }, answer: "B", explanation: "tar -c creates an archive, -f specifies the filename. So tar -cf work.tar ./work/ creates work.tar from the contents of ./work/. Other options use invalid syntax." },
  { id: 19, question: "Which of the following keys can be pressed to exit less?", options: { A: "l", B: "x", C: "e", D: "q", E: "!" }, answer: "D", explanation: "Pressing q quits the less pager. The other keys have different functions (e.g. navigation, search) but do not exit." },
  { id: 20, question: "The file test.sh is a valid shell script. How can this script be executed? (Choose two.)", options: { A: "run test.sh", B: "${test.sh}", C: "cmd ./test.sh", D: "./test.sh", E: "bash test.sh" }, answer: "DE", explanation: "./test.sh runs the script in the current directory (needs execute permission). bash test.sh runs it with bash regardless of execute bit. run, ${test.sh}, and cmd are not standard." },
  { id: 21, question: "Which of the following commands sorts the output of the command export-logs?", options: { A: "export-logs < sort", B: "export-logs > sort", C: "export-logs & sort", D: "export-logs | sort", E: "export-logs <> sort" }, answer: "D", explanation: "The pipe | sends the output of one command as input to the next. So export-logs | sort passes the output of export-logs to sort. < and > redirect to files; & runs in background." },
  { id: 22, question: "A directory contains a.txt and b.txt. What would be the output of: for file in *.txt ... echo $file?", options: { A: "*.txt", B: "a b", C: "c.cav", D: "a.txt", E: "a.txt b.txt" }, answer: "E", explanation: "for file in *.txt iterates over each filename matching *.txt; echo $file prints each name. So with a.txt and b.txt you get a.txt and b.txt (one per line or space-separated)." },
  { id: 23, question: "Which of the following commands will search for the file foo.txt under the directory /home?", options: { A: "search /home -file foo.txt", B: "search /home foo.txt", C: "find /home -file foo.txt", D: "find /home -name foo.txt", E: "find /home foo.txt" }, answer: "D", explanation: "find searches the directory tree. The correct syntax is find /home -name foo.txt. The -name option takes the filename. search is not a standard command." },
  { id: 24, question: "A file has permissions -rw-r--r-- and executing ./test.sh leads to 'Permission denied'. What should be done to successfully execute the script?", options: { A: "The file's extension should be changed from .sh to .bin.", B: "The execute bit should be set in the file's permissions.", C: "The user executing the script should be added to the exec group.", D: "The SetUID bit should be set in the file's permissions.", E: "The script should be run using #!./test.sh instead of ./test.sh." }, answer: "B", explanation: "Permission denied when running ./script usually means the file is not executable. You must add the execute bit (e.g. chmod +x test.sh). Extension and SetUID are irrelevant here." },
  { id: 25, question: "What is a Linux distribution?", options: { A: "The Linux file system as seen from the root account after mounting all file systems.", B: "A bundling of the Linux kernel, system utilities and other software.", C: "The set of rules which governs the distribution of Linux kernel source code.", D: "An operating system based on Linux but incompatible to the regular Linux kernel.", E: "A set of changes to Linux which enable Linux to run on another processor architecture." }, answer: "B", explanation: "A Linux distribution is the kernel plus system utilities, desktop/server software, and package management—e.g. Ubuntu, Fedora. It is not the filesystem view, license rules, or a ported kernel." },
  { id: 26, question: "Which package management tool is used in Red Hat-based Linux Systems?", options: { A: "portage", B: "rpm", C: "apt-get", D: "dpkg", E: "packagectl" }, answer: "B", explanation: "rpm (RPM Package Manager) is used by Red Hat, CentOS, Fedora. apt-get and dpkg are for Debian/Ubuntu; portage is for Gentoo." },
  { id: 27, question: "Which of the following programs is a graphical editor for vector graphics?", options: { A: "Python", B: "NGINX", C: "Samba", D: "Inkscape", E: "MySQL" }, answer: "D", explanation: "Inkscape is a vector graphics editor. Python is a language; NGINX is a web server; Samba is for file sharing; MySQL is a database." },
  { id: 28, question: "Where is the operating system of a Raspberry Pi stored?", options: { A: "On the master device attached to the Raspberry Pi's IDE bus.", B: "On a read only partition on the Raspberry Pi's firmware, next to the BIOS.", C: "On a removable SD card which is put into the Raspberry Pi.", D: "On a Linux extension module connected to the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins.", E: "On rewritable flash storage which is built into the Raspberry Pi." }, answer: "C", explanation: "Raspberry Pi has no built-in storage for the OS. The system and user data are stored on a removable SD (or microSD) card that you insert into the board." },
  { id: 29, question: "What is defined by a Free Software license?", options: { A: "Details of the technical documentation each contributor has to provide.", B: "The programming languages which may be used to extend the licensed program.", C: "A complete list of libraries required to compile the licensed software.", D: "Limits on the purposes for which the licensed software may be used.", E: "Conditions for modifying and distributing the licensed software." }, answer: "E", explanation: "Free Software licenses define how you may use, modify, and distribute the software (e.g. GPL). They do not define documentation, languages, library lists, or usage limits." },
  { id: 30, question: "Why are web browser cookies considered dangerous?", options: { A: "Cookies support identification and tracking of users.", B: "Cookies are always public and accessible to anyone on the internet.", C: "Cookies consume significant amounts of storage and can exhaust disk space.", D: "Cookies store critical data which is lost when a cookie is deleted.", E: "Cookies can contain and execute viruses and malware." }, answer: "A", explanation: "Cookies can identify and track users across sites, which raises privacy concerns. They do not execute code, are not always public, and do not usually exhaust disk space." },
  { id: 31, question: "Which of the following are typical services offered by public cloud providers? (Choose three.)", options: { A: "Platform as a Service (PaaS)", B: "Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)", C: "Internet as a Service (IaaS)", D: "Graphics as a Service (GaaS)", E: "Software as a Service (SaaS)" }, answer: "ABE", explanation: "The main cloud service models are IaaS (virtual machines), PaaS (platform for apps), and SaaS (software as a service). GaaS and 'Internet as a Service' are not standard models." },
  { id: 32, question: "Which of the following characters in a shell prompt indicates the shell is running with root privileges?", options: { A: "!", B: "#", C: "*", D: "&", E: "$" }, answer: "B", explanation: "The # (hash) at the end of the prompt indicates root or superuser. Regular users typically see $ (dollar). ! * & are used for history, wildcards, and background jobs." },
  { id: 33, question: "Which of the following commands are used to get information on the proper use of ls? (Choose two.)", options: { A: "option ls", B: "usage ls", C: "manual ls", D: "man ls", E: "info ls" }, answer: "DE", explanation: "man opens manual pages; info opens info documentation. Both provide usage and option details for commands like ls. option, usage, and manual are not valid commands." },
  { id: 34, question: "What is true about a recursive directory listing?", options: { A: "It includes the content of sub-directories.", B: "It includes the permissions of the directory listed.", C: "It includes details of file system internals, such as inodes.", D: "It includes ownership information for the files.", E: "It includes a preview of content for each file in the directory." }, answer: "A", explanation: "A recursive listing (e.g. ls -R) shows the contents of the given directory and all of its subdirectories. Permissions and ownership may be shown with -l but are not what 'recursive' means." },
  { id: 35, question: "Running 'rm Downloads' leads to: rm: cannot remove 'Downloads/': Is a directory. Which commands can be used to remove Downloads? (Choose two.)", options: { A: "undir Downloads", B: "rmdir Downloads", C: "dir -r Downloads", D: "rem Downloads", E: "rm -r Downloads" }, answer: "BE", explanation: "rm cannot remove directories by default. rmdir removes empty directories. rm -r removes directories recursively (and their contents). undir, dir -r, rem are not standard." },
  { id: 36, question: "Which of the following directories contains information, documentation and example configuration files for installed software packages?", options: { A: "/usr/share/doc/", B: "/etc/defaults/", C: "/var/info/", D: "/doc/", E: "/usr/examples/" }, answer: "A", explanation: "Package documentation and example configs are typically installed under /usr/share/doc/. /etc/defaults, /var/info, /doc, and /usr/examples are not standard for this." },
  { id: 37, question: "Which of the following commands adds the directory /new/dir/ to the PATH environment variable?", options: { A: "$PATH=/new/dir:$PATH", B: "PATH=/new/dir:PATH", C: "export PATH=/new/dir:PATH", D: "export $PATH=/new/dir:$PATH", E: "export PATH=/new/dir:$PATH" }, answer: "E", explanation: "To add to PATH you must export the variable. Use export PATH=/new/dir:$PATH so the new directory is prepended and existing PATH is kept. $ is needed when referencing the current PATH value." },
  { id: 38, question: "A user is in /home/user/Downloads/ and runs: ls ../Documents/. Which directory's content is displayed?", options: { A: "/home/user/Documents/", B: "/home/user/Documents/Downloads/", C: "/home/user/Downloads/Documents/", D: "/Documents/", E: "/home/Documents" }, answer: "A", explanation: "From /home/user/Downloads/, .. means the parent directory /home/user. So ../Documents/ is /home/user/Documents/. The content listed is that of /home/user/Documents/." },
  { id: 39, question: "A directory contains: texts 1.txt, texts 2.txt, texts 3.csv. Which command copies the two files ending in .txt to /tmp/?", options: { A: "cp ??.txt /tmp/", B: "cp *.txt /tmp/", C: "cp .\\.txt /tmp/", D: "cp ?.txt /tmp/", E: "cp $?.txt /tmp/" }, answer: "B", explanation: "The * wildcard matches any characters. So *.txt matches all files ending in .txt (e.g. texts 1.txt, texts 2.txt). ? matches only one character; the other options use invalid syntax." },
  { id: 40, question: "When typing a long command line at the shell, what single character can be used to split a command across multiple lines? (FILL BLANK)", options: null, answer: "\\", explanation: "A backslash at the end of a line continues the command to the next line. The shell treats the newline as part of the same command. Pipe | is for chaining commands, not line continuation." },
  { id: 41, question: "Which of the following DNS record types hold an IP address? (Choose two.)", options: { A: "NS", B: "AAAA", C: "MX", D: "A", E: "CNAME" }, answer: "BD", explanation: "A records map hostnames to IPv4 addresses; AAAA records map to IPv6 addresses.

(Choose two.)", options: { A: "During a file system check, the file is moved to /lost+found.", B: "The file is removed from the file system.", C: "The UID of the former owner is shown when listing the file's details.", D: "The user root is set as the new owner of the file.", E: "Ownership and permissions of the file remain unchanged." }, answer: "CE", explanation: "When a user is deleted, their files remain. The files keep the same permissions; listing shows the numeric UID of the former owner (orphaned). Root is not auto-assigned as new owner." },
  { id: 51, question: "Which statements about the directory /etc/skel are correct? (Choose two.)", options: { A: "The personal user settings of root are stored in this directory.", B: "The files are copied to the home directory when starting the system.", C: "The files are copied to the home directory of a new user when the account is created.", D: "The directory contains a default set of configuration files used by the useradd command.", E: "The directory contains the global settings for the Linux system." }, answer: "CD", explanation: "/etc/skel holds template files copied into new users' home directories when the account is created (e.g. by useradd).

(Choose two.)", options: { A: "Change a user's username.", B: "Change a user's password.", C: "Create a new user account.", D: "Create a new user group.", E: "Lock a user account." }, answer: "CE", explanation: "passwd can change a user's password and lock an account (passwd -l). Creating users is done with useradd; creating groups with groupadd. passwd does not change usernames." },
  { id: 55, question: "What is true about the su command?", options: { A: "It is the default shell of the root account.", B: "It can only be used by the user root.", C: "It runs a shell or command as another user.", D: "It changes the name of the main administrator account.", E: "It locks the root account in specific time frames." }, answer: "C", explanation: "su (substitute user) runs a shell or command as another user. It is not the root shell name, not root-only, and does not change account names or lock root." },
  { id: 56, question: "What parameter of ls prints a recursive listing of a directory's content? (FILL BLANK - option name only)", options: null, answer: "-R", explanation: "ls -R (or --recursive) lists directories recursively—each directory and its subdirectories. The question asks for the option name only, so -R." },
  { id: 57, question: "Most commands on Linux can display information on their usage. How can this information typically be displayed?", options: { A: "By running the command with the option /? or /??.", B: "By running the command with the option ?! or ?=!.", C: "By running the command with the option /doc or /documentation.", D: "By running the command with the option -h or --help.", E: "By running the command with the option -m or --manpage." }, answer: "D", explanation: "Most commands support -h or --help to show usage. man is a separate command (man commandname). There is no standard /?, --manpage, or similar option." },
  { id: 58, question: "Which of the following commands shows the absolute path to the current working directory?", options: { A: "who", B: "cd ..", C: "pwd", D: "ls -l", E: "cd ~/home" }, answer: "C", explanation: "pwd (print working directory) prints the full path of the current directory. who shows logged-in users; cd changes directory; ls -l lists files; cd ~/home is just a path." },
  { id: 59, question: "Which of the following commands output the content of the file 'Texts 2.txt'? (Choose two.)", options: { A: "cat 'Texts 2.txt'", B: "cat -- Texts 2.txt", C: "cat |Texts 2.txt|", D: "cat 'Texts\\ 2.txt'", E: "cat Texts\\ 2.txt" }, answer: "AE", explanation: "To handle a space in the filename: quote it (cat 'Texts 2.txt') or escape the space (cat Texts\\ 2.txt). The pipe and backslash in D/E are for escaping the space." },
  { id: 60, question: "Which command displays file names only and no additional information?", options: { A: "ls -a", B: "ls -lh", C: "ls -l", D: "ls -alh", E: "ls -nl" }, answer: "A", explanation: "ls -a shows names only (including hidden files). All other options use -l (long format), which adds permissions, owner, size, etc." },
  { id: 61, question: "What is the purpose of the PATH environment variable?", options: { A: "It allows the execution of commands without the need to know the location of the executable.", B: "It increases security by preventing commands from running in certain locations.", C: "It specifies the location of a user's home directory.", D: "It indicates the location of the default shell to be used when a user logs in.", E: "It contains the absolute path to the current directory." }, answer: "A", explanation: "PATH lists directories searched when you run a command, so you can run executables without typing their full path. It does not define home dir, shell, or current directory." },
  { id: 62, question: "Which of the following commands sets the variable USERNAME to the value bob?", options: { A: "set USERNAME bob", B: "$USERNAME==bob", C: "var USERNAME=bob", D: "USERNAME<=bob", E: "USERNAME=bob" }, answer: "E", explanation: "In shell, set a variable with NAME=value (no spaces around =). No set, var, or $ on the left. So USERNAME=bob is correct." },
  { id: 63, question: "What command displays manual pages? (FILL BLANK - command only)", options: null, answer: "man", explanation: "The man command displays manual pages (e.g. man ls). info also shows documentation, but man is the standard command for manual pages." },
  { id: 64, question: "Which command copies the contents of the directory /etc/, including all sub-directories, to /root/?", options: { A: "copy /etc /root", B: "cp -r /etc/* /root", C: "cp -v /etc/* /root", D: "rcp /etc/* /root", E: "cp -R /etc/*.* /root" }, answer: "B", explanation: "cp -r (recursive) copies directories and their contents. So cp -r /etc/* /root copies everything under /etc to /root. copy and rcp are not standard; *.* would miss files without a dot." },
  { id: 65, question: "Which of the following commands puts the lines of the file data.csv into alphabetical order?", options: { A: "a..z data.csv", B: "sort data.csv", C: "abc data.csv", D: "wc -s data.csv", E: "grep --sort data.csv" }, answer: "B", explanation: "The sort command sorts lines of input. sort data.csv sorts the file alphabetically by line. a..z, abc, wc, grep do not sort files." },
  { id: 66, question: "Which of the following examples shows the general structure of a for loop in a shell script?", options: { A: "for *.txt as file => echo $file", B: "for *.txt ( echo $i )", C: "for file in *.txt do echo $i done", D: "for ls *.txt exec {} \\;", E: "foreach @{file} { echo $i }" }, answer: "C", explanation: "Bash for loop: for variable in list; do commands; done. So 'for file in *.txt do echo $i done' matches the structure (do/done, variable in list). Other options use invalid syntax." },
  { id: 67, question: "Which operator in a regular expression matches the preceding character either zero or one time?", options: { A: "?", B: "*", C: "+", D: "%", E: "$" }, answer: "A", explanation: "In regex, ? means the previous character 0 or 1 time. * means 0 or more; + means 1 or more. So ? is 'zero or one'." },
  { id: 68, question: "The file script.sh contains: #!/bin/bash echo $MYVAR. Running 'MYVAR=value ./script.sh' gives an empty line. How should MYVAR be set to display its content?", options: { A: "!MYVAR=value", B: "env MYVAR=value", C: "MYVAR=value", D: "$MYVAR=value", E: "export MYVAR=value" }, answer: "E", explanation: "Variables set as VAR=value before a command are only for that command and are not passed to child processes. export makes the variable available to child processes, so the script sees MYVAR." },
  { id: 69, question: "What is the return value of a shell script after successful execution?", options: { A: "1", B: "0", C: "-1", D: "-255", E: "255" }, answer: "B", explanation: "A successful command returns exit code 0. Non-zero (e.g. 1, 255) indicates an error. This is standard in Unix/Linux." },
  { id: 70, question: "Which command creates the ZIP archive poems.zip containing all files in the current directory whose names end in .txt?", options: { A: "zip *.txt > poems.zip", B: "zcat *.txt poems.zip", C: "zip poems.zip *.txt", D: "zip cfz poems.zip *.txt", E: "cat *.txt | zip poems.zip" }, answer: "C", explanation: "zip takes the archive name first, then files: zip poems.zip *.txt. Redirection > or pipes do not create zip archives; zcat is for reading; cfz is not valid." },
  { id: 71, question: "Which of the following statements are true regarding a typical shell script? (Choose two.)", options: { A: "It has the executable permission bit set.", B: "It starts with the two character sequence #!.", C: "It is located in /usr/local/scripts/.", D: "It is located in /etc/bash/scripts/.", E: "It is compiled into a binary file compatible with the current machine architecture." }, answer: "AB", explanation: "Shell scripts are text files with the execute bit set and usually start with #! (shebang) to specify the interpreter. They are interpreted, not compiled, and have no fixed location." },
  { id: 72, question: "Which of the following commands extracts the contents of the compressed archive file1.tar.gz?", options: { A: "tar -czf file1.tar.gz", B: "ztar file1.tar.gz", C: "tar -xzf file1.tar.gz", D: "tar --extract file1.tar.gz", E: "detar file1.tar.gz" }, answer: "C", explanation: "tar -x extracts, -z decompresses gzip, -f specifies the file. So tar -xzf file1.tar.gz extracts the .tar.gz archive. -czf would create; ztar and detar are not standard." },
  { id: 73, question: "Which command finds all lines in operating-systems.txt which contain the term linux, regardless of case?", options: { A: "igrep linux operating-systems.txt", B: "less -i linux operating-systems.txt", C: "grep -i linux operating-systems.txt", D: "cut linux operating-systems.txt", E: "cut [Ll][Ii][Nn][Uu][Xx] operating-systems.txt" }, answer: "C", explanation: "grep -i ignores case, so grep -i linux finds 'linux', 'Linux', 'LINUX', etc. igrep and less -i are not standard for this; cut selects columns, not pattern matching." },
  { id: 74, question: "Which one of the following statements concerning Linux passwords is true?", options: { A: "All passwords can be decrypted using the system administrator's master password.", B: "Passwords may never start with a non-letter.", C: "Users cannot change their password once it has been set.", D: "Passwords are only stored in hashed form.", E: "Passwords may be at most six characters long." }, answer: "D", explanation: "Linux stores passwords as one-way hashes in /etc/shadow (not in plain text). They cannot be decrypted. Length and character rules are configurable; users can change passwords." },
  { id: 75, question: "Which of the following programs are web servers? (Choose two.)", options: { A: "Apache HTTPD", B: "Postfix", C: "Curl", D: "Dovecot", E: "NGINX" }, answer: "AE", explanation: "Apache HTTPD and NGINX are web servers. Postfix is mail; Curl is a client; Dovecot is mail (IMAP/POP3)." },
  { id: 76, question: "Which of the following Linux Distributions is derived from Red Hat Enterprise Linux?", options: { A: "Raspbian", B: "openSUSE", C: "Debian", D: "Ubuntu", E: "CentOS" }, answer: "E", explanation: "CentOS is derived from RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux) and is built from the same source. Raspbian is Debian-based; openSUSE, Debian, and Ubuntu are separate families." },
  { id: 77, question: "Which of the following statements is true about Free Software?", options: { A: "It is developed by volunteers only.", B: "It may be modified by anyone using it.", C: "It must always be available free of charge.", D: "It only runs on Linux.", E: "It is only distributed as a compiled binary." }, answer: "B", explanation: "Free Software (e.g. GPL) is about the freedom to use, study, modify, and distribute. It can be modified by anyone—that is the key. It is not necessarily free of charge or volunteer-only." },
  { id: 78, question: "How is a new Linux computing instance provisioned in an IaaS cloud?", options: { A: "The standard Linux installer has to be run through a remote console.", B: "After buying a Linux distribution, its vendor delivers it to a cloud instance.", C: "The installation has to be prepared in a local virtual machine which is then copied to the cloud.", D: "The cloud hosting organization provides a set of pre-prepared images of popular Linux distributions.", E: "A provider-specific configuration file describing the desired installation is uploaded to the cloud provider." }, answer: "D", explanation: "IaaS providers offer pre-built images (e.g. Ubuntu, RHEL) that you select when creating a VM. You do not typically run the installer manually or copy a local VM; images are the standard." },
  { id: 79, question: "What are the differences between a private web browser window and a regular web browser window? (Choose three.)", options: { A: "Private web browser windows do not allow printing or storing websites.", B: "Private web browser windows do not store cookies persistently.", C: "Private web browser windows do not support logins into websites.", D: "Private web browser windows do not keep records in the browser history.", E: "Private web browser windows do not send regular stored cookies." }, answer: "BDE", explanation: "Private/incognito mode: cookies are not stored persistently, history is not kept, and regular cookies are not sent. Printing and logins are still possible." },
  { id: 80, question: "What is the preferred source for the installation of new applications in a Linux based operating system?", options: { A: "The vendor's version management system", B: "A CD-ROM disk", C: "The distribution's package repository", D: "The vendor's website", E: "A retail store" }, answer: "C", explanation: "The distribution's package repository (e.g. apt, dnf) is the preferred source: it provides tested, integrated packages and security updates. Vendor sites and CD-ROMs are secondary." }
